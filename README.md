# COVID-19-News-Verification-using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to determine if a news on COVID-19 is true or not. Different models such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and decision tree were used, with logistic regression outperforming all other models by achieving an accuracy of 0.90.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the following paper:

- Author(s): Limeng Cui and Dongwon Lee
- Title: "CoAID: COVID-19 Healthcare Misinformation Dataset"
- Publication Year: 2020

Please note that the dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through the following [link](https://github.com/cuilimeng/CoAID).


## Conclusion
The logistic regression model outperformed all other models, and can be used as a reliable tool to determine the veracity of news related to COVID-19.
